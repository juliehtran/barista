Welcome to Resilient Cafe, a mock cafe ordering application! Place your order and your name so that a member of staff may take care of you. This app allows the user to order anything! The order goes on the POS system and a member of staff can log in to complete the orders with just a click. Once the orders are complete, the staff can delete the order from the system. If a memmber of staff is new, they may create an account at the sign-up page.
